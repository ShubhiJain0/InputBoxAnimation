# **Project Name**

## **About**
This is a simple input box animation made to make websites more attractive. The animation allows to make the placeholder of input box look as if it is being typed which catches eyes and attention of the user. This was made using framer motion.

## **Hooks used**
- I used react useState for handling the state of animation.
- I used onFocus() hook to stop animation when the user has focus on the input.
- I used onBlur() hook for animation to restart once the user has removed their focus from the input box.
